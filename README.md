**Signature App**
This repository contains a Signature App developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app was created as part of the 30DaysCoding Full Stack MERN course to practice front-end development skills and understand the basics of drawing on the web.

**Project Overview**
The Signature App allows users to draw their signatures directly on a web page. It is a simple, lightweight application that showcases the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive web experiences.

**Technologies Used**

CSS3: For styling the user interface, including the canvas where the signature is drawn.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity, such as drawing on the canvas and clearing the signature.
